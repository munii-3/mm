Greek notes
Linking verbs: Connects the subject of a sentence with a subject complement (noun,pronoun,
adjective that renames or describes the subject)

e.g. in the sentence "Max is excited."
Max=Subject Is=L.Verb Excited=Verb 




articles follow the nouns; gender, case,       number
                           masc.   genitive,   singular 
                           fem.    nominative, plural
                           neut.   accusative
                                   vocative

Adjectives do the same.  They can be placed anywhere. Usually before noun but can be after.
after linking verb, before for emphatic reasons

possessive pronouns- follow noun
e.g το αυτοκίνητό μου - my car

Imperative mood
Verb, (personal pronoun), object
brackets if there are any personal pronouns
e.g.: Πάρε το λεωφορείο! - Take the bus! Δώσε μου το κλειδί! - Give me the key!


Cases
the role of words in the sentence is not indicated by their position but by their cases
